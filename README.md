# GCResizer
this program allows using a [Golden Cursor](https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/goldenCursor.en.html) file on any resolution, it does this by scaling the coordinates in the .gc file to a resolution that you choose.

### note:
This is done automatically and it's not completely accurate, however it should give acceptible results.

## Usage.
Download the latest release from the releases page [Here](https://github.com/mazen428/GCResizer/releases/latest)

Extract and run the executable, the GUI is simple with one button to convert, browse to the file to be converted and select which resolution to convert from and which to convert to.
## Requirements to build.
You should not need to do this as a frozen binary is available in the releases page.

- Python 3.9.
- WxPython.
- py2exe to build.

Simpley run setup.py after.
